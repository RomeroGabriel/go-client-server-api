# Challenge: Currency Exchange System in Go

In this challenge, we will apply our knowledge of HTTP web servers, contexts, database interactions, and file manipulation using Go.

You need to deliver two Go systems:

1. `client.go`
1. `server.go`

## Requirements

### Server.go

1. The endpoint generated by `server.go` for this challenge should be: `/cotacao`, and the HTTP server should use port `8080`.
1. `server.go`: [Should consume the API containing](https://economia.awesomeapi.com.br/json/last/USD-BRL) the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Brazilian Real.
1. `server.go`: Should return only the current exchange rate value ("bid" field from the JSON).
1. Utilizing the `context` package, `server.go` should log each received exchange rate into an `SQLite database`.
1. The maximum `timeout` for calling the Dollar exchange rate API should be `200ms`, and the maximum `timeout` for persisting data in the database should be `10ms`.
1. The systems should use the `context` package to return an error in the logs if the execution time is insufficient.

### Client.go

1. `client.go`: Should make an HTTP request to `server.go` requesting the current exchange rate for the US Dollar.
1. The systems should use the `context` package to return an error in the logs if the execution time is insufficient.
1. `client.go`: Should have a maximum `timeout of 300ms` for receiving the result from `server.go`.
1. `client.go`: Should save the current exchange rate to a file named `cotacao.txt` in the format: `Dollar: {value}`.
